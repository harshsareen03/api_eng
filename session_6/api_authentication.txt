Authentication 

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity before granting access to resources.
Think of it as answering the question:
üëâ ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

2. Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication = proving who you are

Authorization = deciding what you‚Äôre allowed to do after authentication

Example:

Logging into Gmail ‚Üí Authentication

Accessing your inbox but not others‚Äô ‚Üí Authorization

Factors of Authentication

Authentication methods are categorized by factors:

Something you know ‚Üí password, PIN, security questions

Something you have ‚Üí smart card, OTP token, phone, API key

Something you are ‚Üí biometrics like fingerprint, face ID, voice recognition

Somewhere you are ‚Üí location-based (IP/geolocation checks)

Something you do ‚Üí behavioral patterns (typing speed, gestures)

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) combines two or more factors (e.g., password + OTP).--

 Types of Authentication Methods

Password-Based Authentication

Oldest and most common

Weak if users choose bad passwords or reuse them

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Stronger security by requiring multiple factors

Example: Online banking (password + SMS OTP + fingerprint)

Token-Based Authentication

Uses tokens (e.g., JWTs, OAuth tokens) instead of passwords after initial login

Common in APIs and microservices

Biometric Authentication

Fingerprint, facial recognition, iris scans

High security but raises privacy concerns

Certificate-Based Authentication

Uses digital certificates (PKI)

Strong, used in enterprise/VPNs

Single Sign-On (SSO)

One set of credentials grants access to multiple systems

Example: Google login for YouTube, Gmail, Drive

5. Authentication Protocols

Basic Authentication

Username/password sent with every request (insecure if not encrypted with HTTPS)

Digest Authentication

Uses hashing to improve Basic Auth, but still outdated

OAuth 2.0

Delegated authentication for APIs (e.g., ‚ÄúLogin with Google‚Äù)

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)

XML-based, widely used in enterprise SSO

OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Built on OAuth 2.0, adds identity verification

Kerberos

Ticket-based system, common in enterprise (Windows Active Directory)

6. Authentication Lifecycle

Registration ‚Üí User creates identity (username, email, password, etc.)

Login ‚Üí User submits credentials

Verification ‚Üí System checks credentials against stored data

Session creation ‚Üí System issues token/session cookie

Re-authentication (for sensitive actions like money transfers)

7. Modern Authentication Trends

Passwordless authentication (magic links, passkeys, biometrics)

Continuous authentication (monitoring user behavior during session)

Decentralized identity (self-sovereign IDs, blockchain-based auth)

8. Common Attacks on Authentication

Phishing ‚Üí tricking users into revealing credentials

Brute-force ‚Üí guessing passwords via automation

Credential stuffing ‚Üí using leaked passwords from other sites

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) ‚Üí intercepting login traffic

Session hijacking ‚Üí stealing authentication tokens

Defenses: MFA, rate limiting, CAPTCHA, strong password policies, encrypted traffic (TLS), token expiration, anomaly detection
